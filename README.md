**Test Agent** [https://huggingface.co/spaces/rprav007/LangGraph_3_Tool_Research_Agent]

**Tools:**

2. Arxiv - Search research papers and publications that support or refute the claims
3. Google Search - Match claims with reliable sources such as government, fact checking websites to connect the dots

**Workflow:**

**1. Claim Extraction:** The user provides the news article to the agent. Tavily analyzes the text and extracts specific claims that need to be fact-checked.  
**2. Evidence Search:** The agent uses Arxiv to find research papers related to the claims. It also uses Google Search to find reliable sources that can provide evidence.  
**3. Fact-Checking:** The agent compares the claims in the news article with the evidence found in research papers and reliable sources. It assesses the level of support or contradiction for each claim.  
**4. Report Generation:** The agent generates a report summarizing its findings, including:
  * The claims made in the news article.
  * The evidence found to support or refute each claim.
  * An assessment of the veracity of each claim (e.g., "True," "False," "Partially True," "Unverified").

* Fact check - Drinking coffee can increase your risk of developing cancer
